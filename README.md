# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating the implementation of various classification algorithms using Python and PySpark. Each notebook covers a different algorithm, including decision trees, principal component analysis (PCA), and more.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a decision tree classifier using PySpark.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - This notebook showcases the implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction using PySpark.

## Dataset

The classification algorithms are applied to the `data.csv` dataset included in this repository. This dataset contains features and labels used for training and evaluating the models.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PySpark

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```
## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaxenaSim/ML_Algos.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd repositoryname
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.
